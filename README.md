# Personal Expense Tracker

A **Personal Expense Tracker** web application built using **Streamlit** and  **SQLite3**. This app allows users to add expenses, view expense history, and track total expenses by category.

## Features

- **Add Expenses**: Users can add new expenses, categorized by Food, Transport, Entertainment, Bills, or Other.
- **Expense History**: Displays a detailed history of the user’s expenses.
- **Expense Breakdown**: Users can see a breakdown of their expenses by category.
- **Total Expenses**: Displays the total expenses for the logged-in user.
  
## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit (for building interactive web applications in Python)
- **Backend**: SQLite3 (for storing user expenses)
- **Data Visualization**: Pandas and Streamlit charts

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/personal-expense-tracker.git
    cd personal-expense-tracker
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install required dependencies**:

    Install all necessary Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up the SQLite3 database**:

    - The database file `expenses.db` will be automatically created when the app is run for the first time.


5. **Run the app**:

    Once everything is set up, run the Streamlit app:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

6. **Access the app**:

    Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to see the app in action.
